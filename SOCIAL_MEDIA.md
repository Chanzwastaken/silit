🚀 Excited to share my latest project: SILIT - A Real-Time Sign Language Translator

🎯 What it does:
SILIT uses computer vision and deep learning to recognize American Sign Language hand gestures and translate them to text in real-time. It's designed to help bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-users.

🛠️ Technical Highlights:
• MediaPipe for hand tracking (21-point landmark detection)
• Custom TensorFlow neural network (92% accuracy)
• Real-time processing at 30 FPS
• 29 gesture classes (A-Z + special commands)
• Trained on 87,000 images

💡 Key Innovation:
Unlike traditional solutions, SILIT includes gesture-based commands for space and delete, enabling a completely hands-free workflow. No need to touch the keyboard!

📊 Results:
• 92.4% test accuracy
• <80ms latency
• Runs on standard hardware (just a webcam needed)
• Free and open-source

🌟 Impact:
This technology has potential applications in:
• Education (sign language learning)
• Healthcare (patient communication)
• Public services (accessibility kiosks)
• Video conferencing (real-time subtitles)
